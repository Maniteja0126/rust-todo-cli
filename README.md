### **Project Structure**

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.rs         # Main source code for the CLI app
â”œâ”€â”€ task.json           # JSON file to store tasks
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml          # Rust package configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # Documentation for the project
```

---

### **Error Handling**

- If you try to access an **invalid index** (like a task that doesnâ€™t exist), the CLI will print:
  ```
  Invalid task number!
  ```
- If the **task.json** file is missing or corrupted, the application will initialize with an empty task list.
